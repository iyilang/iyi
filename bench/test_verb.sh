# A test is a plain iyi program that exits non-zero to fail. Four steps,
# and every one is a failure proof of a different kind, because a test
# runner's whole job is telling the four verdicts apart:
#
#   1. Passing tests: exit 0, and `--json` reports them as data.
#   2. A failing test: exit 1, the file named, its own output shown.
#   3. A test that does not build: a failure that says so, not a crash.
#   4. A test that hangs: killed at the deadline and named, because a
#      harness that can hang is not a harness.
